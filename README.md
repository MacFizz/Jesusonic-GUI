# Jesusonic-GUI
GUI for JS effects.
Jesusonic is a FX processor programation language used in Cockos Reaper Digital Audio Workstation.
Check it out: http://reaper.fm/
It allows user to make tools, effects and instruments within Reaper.
Dozens of effects are included with Reaper from the start and hundreds of effects are available from various users.
However, many tools and effects only use the default GUI. Thats is very basic horizontal sliders and dropdown menus.

As I'm extremely frustrated about the JS default GUI, I took upon myself to make GUI and packages of the JSFX I use.
